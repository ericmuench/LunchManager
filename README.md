# LunchManager
This Android-App can manage the Lunch of a Family. It helps to decide, which Food to cook so that everybody likes the food. The main ulterior motive behind this app was the following:


If you cook for a family it is hard to find out which food to cook due to the fact that each person likes/ not likes different dishes and ingredients. Because of this issue the 
LunchManager can manage persons and dishes and suggest dishes to cook depending on which persons are present for a meal. The goal is to suggest a food that is liked by everyone.
